# Tracklist To Audacity Label Format Converter

A simple script which converts a text file containing audio track listings into a text file that adheres to Audacity's proprietary format for importing labels.

## Background
Certain long-duration audio files (such as DJ sets) will often need to be divided into parts for easier listening and organization. For these types of audio files, a text tracklist of start and end timecodes is usually provided. However, using this tracklist to cut the audio file into chunks manually can be time-consuming and inefficient.

Audacity provides a means to cut an audio track into segments using its label feature. Labels in audacity can be managed in its dedicated Label Editor window, and sets of labels can be imported from files that match a proprietary label format.

## About
This script aims to convert a typical tracklist you would find with DJ sets and mixed albums into a text file that Audacity can use to place labels to divide up the recording.

The script currently takes one runtime argument, which is the path to a file with a valid tracklist. For a tracklist to be considered valid by the program, each track should be listed on a separate line in the file and adhere to the following format: "H:MM:SS song-name - artist".

A sample tracklist, sample_track_list.txt, has been provided in the repository for reference as an example of a valid tracklist. Please copy this same format when making your own tracklist to provide to this program.

The result of running the script with a valid tracklist will be an output file, output.txt, which can then be imported into Audacity's Label Editor window (accessed via Edit -> Labels -> Label Editor) to add labels to the referenced audio recording. You can then choose to divide up the audio recording by the labels upon export.

## Example Usage
I downloaded and extracted the audio from the following DJ set using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmqlJOb9yNc

I then took a tracklist I found in a comment on the video and put it into a text file (the contents of the provided sample_track_list.txt):

Then, I put this text file in the same directory as the Tracklist To Audacity Label Format Converter script and ran it with the text file name as a runtime argument:

I opened Audacity and loaded the extracted audio file. Then, I opened the Label Editor by selecting Edit -> Labels -> Label Editor:

In the Label Editor window, I clicked the "Import" button and selected the output.txt file generated by the script:

I deleted the first label since it wasn't needed (click to highlight the first label and hit "Delete") before clicking "OK". I then deleted the default label track since it was empty and I just created a new one.

Then I made my edits to the audio and finally exported the files (File -> Export Audio) by selecting to export multiple files by label name:

And that's it!
